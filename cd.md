# `cd`
Change the working directory

## Comments
`cd <directory>` When directory starts with `/` it's an absolute path, otherwise it's relative

`cd` by itself or `cd ~` will always put you in your home directory

`cd /` will put you in root directory

`cd .` will leave you in the same directory you are currently in

`cd ~<username>` will put you in username's home directory

`cd ..` will move you up one directory, `cd ../..` moves you up two lewels etc.

`cd -` will switch you to the previous directory
