# `mv`
Move or rename files
`mv <source> <destination>`

## Options
`-b` make a backup of each existing destination file

`-t <directory>` move all &lt;source&gt; arguments into &lt;directory&gt;

`-u` (update) move only when the &lt;source&gt; file is newer than the destination file or when the &lt;destination&gt; file is missing

`-v` explain what is being done

## Comments
In case of renaming file treat &lt;destination&gt; just as new name of file.
